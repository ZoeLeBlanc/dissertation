# Data Sources
This directory contains all the datasets for my dissertations. Unfortunately, these datasets are not accessible on this Github repository due to copyright restrictions, but I am open to sharing them on a case by case basis. 

Each directory contains the data from one publication, and then the various transformed datasets I use in my analyses.

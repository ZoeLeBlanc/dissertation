# Data Experiments

This repository is a collection of scripts and jupyter notebooks written over the course of 2018-2019 for my dissertation analysis.

This collection was initially compiled in February 2019 as a space to deposit previous drafts of scripts, some of which in more coherent forms are used in the dissertation, so that I wouldn't have this material spread across several folders. 

None of these scripts will work since no data is included in this repository and some of the necessary libraries were compiled locally (looking at you rpy2). Nonetheless, this repository is good snapshot of my work over the last year if you're interested.

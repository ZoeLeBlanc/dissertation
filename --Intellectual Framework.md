Though historians traditionally eschew theory, I believe that a project like mine - that bridges multiple regions and scales - requires some discussion of how I plan to organize, and, perhaps more importantly, delimit the scope of this study. With the use of these digital tools and my extensive datasets, there is a temptation to indulge in mission creep, and essentially produce a panopticon of politics and society in Cairo. To avoid this fate and focus my study, I have developed an intellectual framework that leverages both theory and previous historical models. Thus, many of the historiographies I previously discussed provide both a foundation for content and a template for structuring my project. For example, I incorporate: the emphasis on narratives and memories in works on modern Egypt; the focus on global movements and international politics in the international histories of nonalignment and the Third World; and the construction of Cairo as a space from urban histories. (NOTE:  Scott, James C. Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed. (New Haven, CT: Yale UP, 1998).) In addition to these works, my project also draws from the history of ideas, the new global intellectual history, and spatial history. As I discussed in my introduction, my two primary models are Michael Goebel’s *Anti-Imperial Metropolis* on Interwar Paris and Jeffrey Byrne’s *Mecca of Revolution* on Algeria, both of which are exemplary international histories of space and movements. In terms of histories of ideas, this project draws from Daniel Rodger’s *Age of Fracture, *Erez Manela’s *The Wilsonian Moment: Self-Determination and the International Origins of Anticolonial Nationalism*, and Mark Mazower’s *Governing the World: The History of an Idea*. I push Rodger’s insightful argument about the fragmenting of identities and solidarities in America during the late 70s and 80s to the earlier Egyptian context to understand the fracturing of these anti-colonial solidarities and identities. Both Manela and Mazower’s books offer models for understanding how political imaginings travel across borders and help construct international movements. Manela and Mazower’s works also exemplify the new trend in intellectual history to explore questions from a global perspective. (NOTE:  Sebastian Conrad, What Is Global History? (Princeton, US: Princeton University Press, 2016); Diego Adrian Olstein. Thinking History Globally. (Hampshire: Palsgrave Macmillan, 2014).) This global approach builds upon the work of historians of international relations and empire, who have long emphasized the analytical category of ‘power’ as a subject for historical inquiry, especially the ways power encourages and halts certain flows of ideas and people across networks. (NOTE:  For overview, see Paul Kramer, "Power and Connection: Imperial Histories of the United States in the World," American Historical Review (December 2011) 1348-1391.)  For my project, Frederick Cooper’s definition of discourses as “coercive power” is critical, as well as his argument that discursive power can constitute and frustrate certain power formations. (NOTE:  Cooper, Frederick, Decolonization and African Society: The Labor Question in French and British Africa (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge UP, 1996) 15.) Thus, considering both ideas, discourses, and power is central to my framework, and helps elucidate both the aspirations and limitations of Cairo’s anti-colonial vision. 

My project also relies on many of the insights of Science Studies, especially research into how ideas are constructed and travel across networks. (NOTE:  For example, see Howlett, Peter and Mary S. Morgan, How Well Do Facts Travel? The Dissemination of Reliable Knowledge (2011).) These works touch on an important piece of my project - networks. Social network analysis and social movement theory both provide useful foundations for tracing these anti-colonial networks. However, my method diverges slightly from traditional social networks, since instead of tracing these networks from place to place, I trace the networks within Cairo and focus on their intersections in this space. Thus, I bridge social movement and network studies with the growing field of spatial history. As I mentioned previously, urban historians have long studied Cairo, and many of these works employ some degree of a ‘spatial’ framework. However, spatial history as a distinct field has grown exponentially since the advent of the ‘spatial turn’ with Henri Lefebvre’s *The Production of Space. *Part of this spatial turn\* \*is also the result of new mapping technologies, which have enabled synthesizing and visualizing large amounts of historical information. Geographers, sociologists, and anthropologists have long used these tools, such as Geographic Imaging Systems (GIS), and now historians interested in the spatial turn are using these same programs to map how people have interacted with spaces over time, (NOTE:  For more in depth discussion see Ian N. Gregory and Alistair Geddes, Toward Spatial Humanities: Historical GIS and Spatial History. (Indiana UP, 2014).) essentially analyzing and visualization of large historical datasets. (NOTE:  For example see Cameron Blevins, Geography of the Post http://cameronblevins.org/gotp/ and Digital Scholarship Lab University of Richmond, American Panorama Project https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/.) Most of these projects cover large geographic spaces or time periods, yet I believe that some of these methods can also be used for a more limited scope, such as the 1950s and 60s in Cairo. In fact, I believe that using both spatial theory and these new tools will help identify the parts of Cairo that were most actively involved in this anti-colonial vision, as well as how the Egyptian print media constructed a global anti-colonial geography around Cairo.

Analyzing complex historical data and extracting patterns is not easy, but there are successful models. One in particular is Cameron Blevins’ work on mapping the production of space in late nineteenth century Houston newspapers. In an article and companion methods piece, Blevins outlines how he mapped the construction and production of space in two daily newspapers, quantifying where and which places appeared in the newspaper and how these place names were part of envisioning new regional and national spaces. Blevins utilizes Franco Moretti’s method of ‘distant reading’, which uses large datasets to extract patterns about literature. Blevins employs distant reading to study how the newspaper discussed place, and argues that collectively all the articles and advertisements were part of imaging new regional spaces. Blevins’ work is a model both for his compelling argument, and because he outlines his method. Blevins first transforms the newspapers into a machine readable format, and then uses a combination of frequency analysis and content sampling to extract both the amount of place names and where in the newspaper each place was mentioned - whether in advertisements or the front page, etc…. Blevins explicitly states that the method is far from perfect with the data often producing errors. Nonetheless, he is able to explore these larger patterns within the newspapers, and then blend this meta-analysis with a more traditional narrative and close reading approach. Essentially, Blevins turns the traditional historical approach of closely reading a text and then extrapolating its importance on its head, using distant reading to first extrapolate the patterns and then closely reading certain articles to understand particular moments. Ultimately, Blevins persuasively uses this method to argue that regional conceptions of space trumped national ones, even though this period is traditionally thought of as one of national consolidation. 

This digital/computational method for exploring places can also be applied to ideas, or more specifically clusters of words that represent ideas and discourses. (NOTE:  For more, see Geoffrey Rockwell and Stefan Sinclair, Hermeneutica: Computer-Assisted Interpretation in the Humanities. (MIT Press, 2016); Shawn Graham, Ian Milligan, and Scott Weingart, Exploring Big Historical Data: The Historian’s Macroscope. (London: Imperial College Press, 2016) Historian’s Macroscope, Taylor Arnold and Lauren Tilton, Humanities Data in R: Exploring Networks, Geospatial Data, Images, and Text. (Cham: Springer, 2015). ) However, whether studying places or ideas, this method involves abstracting text, and there is a danger of misinterpreting these patterns and overstating their significance. Yet, even with this cautionary admission, I still believe that this approach provides a novel way of understanding my sources at a different scale, especially around the question of how discourses and meanings around ideas, places, and people change over time. One model of this method is Micki Kaufman’s Quantifying Kissinger project that explores the constellation of ideas in memcons and telcons from Kissinger’s time in the Nixon White House. Kaufman uses a number of corpus linguistic tools to explore how both the content and tone of these sources changed over time. I plan to use these same methods and tools to explore and compare Egyptian print media, government documents, and non-Egyptian print media envisioned Cairo’s role in anti-colonialism. 

Taken together, ideas, discourses, power, networks, and spaces, provide a robust analytical framework, which when combined with close and distant reading methods are the foundation for this study. Exploring the historiographical and intellectual background for this project is critical, even if it is a bit dry, because my dissertation is not one with obvious edges. Edges are the limits of a project that for historians usually involve choosing to focus on the life of one person or group. My project has limits (space: Cairo, time period: 1950s and 1960s) but the people and ideas involved are wide ranging. Thus, I believe that my intellectual framework can help focus my project productively, while also enabling me to draw on a diverse range of literatures and sources. Ultimately, my strongest rationale for using this framework is that the story of anti-colonial Cairo has remained on the margins, and this approach will help me uncover this elusive place in time.

**Appendix B. Expanded Methods Section**

**Intellectual Framework**

Though historians traditionally eschew theory, I believe that a project like mine - that bridges multiple regions and scales - requires some discussion of how I plan to organize, and, perhaps more importantly, delimit the scope of this study. With the use of these digital tools and my extensive datasets, there is a temptation to indulge in mission creep, and essentially produce a panopticon of media, politics, and society in Cairo. To delimit my study, I have outlined in this section my current intellectual framework, which attempts to weave together theory, previous historical models, and the scale of my project. Scale in particular is critical to my project, as I am attempting to identify patterns in my media analysis around historical events, places, and figures, as well as ideas, is only possible if I have am able to compare trends across a broad swath of historical evidence. This approach is necessary because of the lack of accessible archives in Cairo, which makes inferring the impact of policy in media production and the relationship between media and politics difficult. Nonetheless, the sheer output of print and audio-visual media in Cairo represents a unique opportunity to leverage newer methodologies for managing large amounts of evidence to explore how shifting discourses occurred in tandem with changes in the U.A.R.’s policies and priorities. Ultimately, my method is not so much a search for ground truth into the meaning of anti-colonialism, but rather an investigation into the spectrum of meanings and how they changed over time.

Many of the historiographies I previously discussed provide both a foundation for content and a template for structuring my project. For example, I incorporate: the emphasis on narratives and memories in works on modern Egypt; the focus on global movements and international politics in the international histories of nonalignment and the Third World; and the construction of Cairo as a space from urban histories. (NOTE:  Scott, James C. Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed. (New Haven, CT: Yale UP, 1998).) In addition to these works, my project also draws from the history of ideas, the new global intellectual history, and spatial history. As I discussed in my introduction, two models are Michael Goebel’s *Anti-Imperial Metropolis* on Interwar Paris and Jeffrey Byrne’s *Mecca of Revolution* on Algeria, both of which are exemplary international histories of space and movements. In terms of histories of ideas, this project draws from Daniel Rodger’s *Age of Fracture, *Erez Manela’s *The Wilsonian Moment: Self-Determination and the International Origins of Anticolonial Nationalism*, and Mark Mazower’s *Governing the World: The History of an Idea*. I push Rodger’s insightful argument about the fragmenting of identities and solidarities in America during the late 70s and 80s to the earlier Egyptian context to understand the fracturing of these anti-colonial solidarities and identities. Both Manela and Mazower’s books offer models for understanding how political imaginings travel across borders and help construct international movements. Manela and Mazower’s works also exemplify the new trend in intellectual history to explore questions from a global perspective. (NOTE:  Sebastian Conrad, What Is Global History? (Princeton, US: Princeton University Press, 2016); Diego Adrian Olstein. Thinking History Globally. (Hampshire: Palsgrave Macmillan, 2014).) This global approach builds upon the work of historians of international relations and empire, who have long emphasized the analytical category of ‘power’ as a subject for historical inquiry, especially the ways power encourages and halts certain flows of ideas and people across networks. (NOTE:  For overview, see Paul Kramer, "Power and Connection: Imperial Histories of the United States in the World," American Historical Review (December 2011) 1348-1391.)  For my project, Frederick Cooper’s definition of discourses as “coercive power” is critical, as well as his argument that discursive power can constitute and frustrate certain power formations. (NOTE:  Cooper, Frederick, Decolonization and African Society: The Labor Question in French and British Africa (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge UP, 1996) 15.) For media history, as I mentioned Walter Armbrust and Tarik Sabry’s work are particularly instructive in how I am conceiving of the U.A.R.’s media and press. I also utilize Laura James and Sönke Kunkel’s emphasis on imagery and symbolism in media for my analysis of cartoons and photographs in Cairo’s print media. Thus, considering both ideas and discourses, and their relationship to the form of media and politics is central to my framework, and helps elucidate both the aspirations and limitations of Cairo’s anti-colonial vision. 

Analyzing complex historical data and extracting patterns is not easy, but there are successful models. One in particular is Cameron Blevins’ work on mapping the production of space in late nineteenth century Houston newspapers. In an article and companion methods piece, Blevins outlines how he mapped the construction and production of space in two daily newspapers, quantifying where and which places appeared in the newspaper and how these place names were part of envisioning new regional and national spaces. Blevins utilizes Franco Moretti’s method of ‘distant reading’, which uses large datasets to extract patterns about literature. Blevins employs distant reading to study how the newspaper discussed place, and argues that collectively all the articles and advertisements were part of imaging new regional spaces. Blevins’ work is a model both for his compelling argument, and because he outlines his method. Blevins first transforms the newspapers into a machine readable format, and then uses a combination of frequency analysis and content sampling to extract both the amount of place names and where in the newspaper each place was mentioned - whether in advertisements or the front page, etc…. Blevins explicitly states that the method is far from perfect with the data often producing errors. Nonetheless, he is able to explore these larger patterns within the newspapers, and then blend this meta-analysis with a more traditional narrative and close reading approach. Essentially, Blevins turns the traditional historical approach of closely reading a text and then extrapolating its importance on its head, using distant reading to first extrapolate the patterns and then closely reading certain articles to understand particular moments. Ultimately, Blevins persuasively uses this method to argue that regional conceptions of space trumped national ones, even though this period is traditionally thought of as one of national consolidation. 

This digital/computational method for exploring places can also be applied to ideas, or more specifically clusters of words that represent ideas and discourses. (NOTE:  For more, see Geoffrey Rockwell and Stefan Sinclair, Hermeneutica: Computer-Assisted Interpretation in the Humanities. (MIT Press, 2016); Shawn Graham, Ian Milligan, and Scott Weingart, Exploring Big Historical Data: The Historian’s Macroscope. (London: Imperial College Press, 2016) Historian’s Macroscope, Taylor Arnold and Lauren Tilton, Humanities Data in R: Exploring Networks, Geospatial Data, Images, and Text. (Cham: Springer, 2015). ) However, whether studying places or ideas, this method involves abstracting text, and there is a danger of misinterpreting these patterns and overstating their significance. Yet, even with this cautionary admission, I still believe that this approach provides a novel way of understanding my sources at a different scale, especially around the question of how discourses and meanings around ideas, places, and people change over time. One model of this method is Micki Kaufman’s Quantifying Kissinger project that explores the constellation of ideas in memcons and telcons from Kissinger’s time in the Nixon White House. Kaufman uses a number of corpus linguistic tools to explore how both the content and tone of these sources changed over time. I plan to use these same methods and tools to explore and compare Egyptian print media, government documents, and non-Egyptian print media envisioned Cairo’s role in anti-colonialism. 

Taken together - ideas, discourses, power, networks, and spaces, provide a robust analytical framework, which when combined with close and distant reading methods are the foundation for this study. Exploring the historiographical and intellectual background for this project is critical, even if it is a bit dry, because my dissertation is not one with obvious edges. My project has limits (space: Cairo, time period: 1950s and 1960s) but the people and ideas involved are wide ranging. Thus, I believe that my intellectual framework can help focus my project productively, while also enabling me to draw on a diverse range of literatures and sources. Ultimately, my strongest rationale for using this framework is that the story of anti-colonial Cairo has remained on the margins, and this approach will help me uncover this elusive place in time. 

**Case Study of Method**

To best demonstrate this digital method, I have developed a small case study from a previous conference paper, entitled Cairo’s Congo Crisis. The paper explores the impact of the Congo Crisis in Cairo, as well as the UAR and Nasser’s role in the conflict. The current Egyptian historiography largely neglects the conflict, and new literature on the Congo crisis still treats Cairo as a marginal actor. In the paper, I argue that this neglect has obscured the coverage of the Congo in the Egyptian press, especially in the early 1960s, and how the conflict became a symbol and rallying point for anti-colonial solidarities. In the paper, I trace the beginning of the UAR’s involvement in African affairs in the mid-1950s from the initial focus on the Sudan to their support for decolonizing states, and specifically Congolese independence in mid-1960. I also explore Nasser’s role in mediating the conflict at the UN, and especially his leadership among nonaligned and radical African states. Lastly, I study the press coverage and protests around the conflict in Cairo, and the eventual marginalizing and forgetting of the Congo in official Egyptian discourses post-1965. For this case study, I explore similar questions using corpus linguistic tools to look at how the constellation of meaning around the Congo changed from 1960 to 1965. 

My corpus for this study is *The Arab Observer, *which was a UAR funded magazine published in English from Cairo. The magazine had the tagline of "the nonaligned weekly", and was circulated to a number of decolonized and Western countries. Thus, *The Arab Observer *provides a useful window into the ‘official’ version of Cairo’s role in the Congo crisis since the publication was largely produced for propagating the UAR’s government vision for anti-colonialism. Many of the articles are unattributed so determining the individuals involved is difficult. Nonetheless, both David Graham Du Bois and Maya Angelou worked on the magazine in the early 1960s. My original paper was based on a wider range of sources, but for this case study focuses on one periodical to limit the number of variables. Also as a point of order, this case study is not intended to provide new information from the paper, but rather validate this method against a thoroughly researched question and dataset. 

For this case study, I primarily use textplot, a statistical modeling tool developed by David McClure. Textplot allows for exploration of both the conceptual and temporal trends over a corpus, which is helpful for historians interested in change over time. (NOTE:  David McClure has a series of blog posts about how textplot works on his website http://dclure.org. For further example of this tool, see Micki Kaufman’s use of the tool here http://blog.quantifyingkissinger.com/2015/01/force-directed-diagram-memcons-and-telcons-textplot/) However, unlike other statistical analyses such as topic modeling, textplot does collapse individual sources into one larger corpus. I may include these alternative methods in my dissertation to help situate and validate my analyses, but for this case study I plan to solely use textplot for brevity’s sake. To organize this study, I first processed my corpus of *The Arab Observer *through an optical character recognition process, which extracted the text with a high accuracy rate. These OCR programs are not perfect but most of the errors are for placeholder words - it, is, are, etc…, rather than more unique words. Unfortunately, this process also removes all the images from the articles, but I do keep all the captions of images, advertisements, and table of contents in the corpus for a more holistic analysis. 

To analyze occurrences of the name Congo in this corpus, I split the corpus into years, each with the following word count: 

* 1960: 290524;

* 1961: 720828;

* 1962: 1179231;

* 1963: 1037616;

* 1964: 679272;

* 1965: 354014.

Both 1960 and 1965 are noticeably smaller because the publication started in mid-1960 and I have been unable to locate many of the issues from 1965. After I completed the OCR process on *The Arab Observer, *I calibrated the textplot settings for each year. (NOTE:  To understand more about how the settings of textplot work, see David McClure http://dclure.org/logs/tuning-textplot/) To enable comparison across years, I tried to find a setting that accurately reflected each corpus year. Ultimately, I decided on the following textplot settings: term depth: 500, skim depth: 20, and bandwidth: 10000. These settings likely seem arbitrary, but just as traditional history requires the somewhat arbitrary choice of a project’s parameters, these settings represent both an arbitrary and calibrated decision. (NOTE:  I chose the particular settings after running numerous tests to calibrate textplot to my corpuses, and if interested I would be willing to share the full spreadsheet where I recorded how the settings altered the output of textplot) Briefly, the term depth sets the number of words to allow in the analysis. Skim depth sets the number of connections between the words. Bandwidth sets the smoothing function of the distribution, allowing me to smooth out irregularities while also keeping the distinctive patterns of each word overall in the text. Ultimately, these settings determine how many terms and connections from the corpus to analyze, and how much to smooth the noise of the corpus to allow for the extraction of meaningful statistical patterns.

Each textplot produces a networked map of the conceptual hubs and linkages in the text. This map shows *The Arab Observer *from 1960, which consisted of 15 issues from the end of June to December. Understanding what this map and textplot visualizes is difficult since the map looks more like spaghetti than an interpretative argument. To give some perspective, David McClure describes textplot as producing mental maps of texts, and he built the program to find how words both flow and cluster within a text. On his blog, McClure uses the case study of *War and Peace *to demonstrate how distinct events in the text, such as battles, have similar characteristics even though they do not appear conterminously in the text. The same is true when he looks at words that cluster around the concept of peace and war, as well as key characters in the book. In the textplot shown above there are fewer distinctive groups, as many of the most central terms appear frequently throughout the corpus, and thus, cluster at the center of the graph. Along the edges of the map, the more distinctive clusters could be labeled: as neutralism, socialist development, imperialism, and international relations. 

These broad labels are not hard and fast, since the map itself is more of a fluid than fixed arrangement. In fact, the ‘spatial’ orientations of these nodes are actually three dimensional, and consequently, examining them in two dimensions flattens many of these connections. Furthermore, the position of each node in the map is relative to every other node. Lastly, the colors of the map are based on running a statistical analysis on the clustering within the network, but these clusters change depending on which the settings of the textplot. To give a sense of how these parameters change, here is the same textplot analysis run through the same network mapping analyses but producing a different layout.

	Though these maps are arbitrary at some level, they are helpful for visualizing these connections and clusters, and as a starting point for digging into this data. As I mentioned previously, this case study is focused on the words that are connected to ‘Congo’, in an effort to understand how the meaning associated with the noun changed over time. This approach is an attempt to historicize the meaning of Congo and how the noun was associated with other concepts in *The Arab Observer*. 
	
	The following table shows the words that are connected to Congo in each year’s corpus, and the words are listed by weight of the connection. Textplot uses kernel density estimates on each word to determine its distribution in the corpus, and then compares the geometric overlap in each distribution, generating a list of words that share most similar density distributions in the corpus. (NOTE:  I do not go into depth on the math or rationale behind this tool, but if interested David McClure has an informative blog post on how textplot works and the reasoning behind how he built it.  http://dclure.org/essays/mental-maps-of-texts/)  This process allows for a more refined assessment of when a word appears in a corpus than base frequency counts.

 

Nonetheless, understanding frequency is important for interpreting the clusters, and this figure visualizes the frequency of Congo in each corpus. The final figure visualizes the concordance plot for each corpus with each line represents one instance of Congo over the course of the corpus.

**Figure 4: Concordance Plots of Congo in ****_The Arab Observer _****corpus by year**

Returning to Table 1, these clusters are helpful for exploring the shifts in the UAR’s relationship to the Congo. As I mentioned earlier, the UAR’s interest in continental politics was largely a product of its relations with the Sudan, and then Nasser’s experience at conferences in New Delhi and Bandung in 1955. (NOTE:  For more on Nasser at New Delhi in 1955, see Carolien Stotle, "The Other Bandung" https://medium.com/afro-asian-visions/the-other-bandung-6b3dcc8e6762#.85iwu8nrp) By 1960, the UAR was actively involved in promoting African solidarities through government-sponsored publications, organizations and conferences, and establishing diplomatic relations with newly decolonized states. Thus, in June 1960, when the Congo declared its independence, the UAR was among the first to send an ambassador to establish relations with the new country. Almost immediately, Moise Tshombe’s announcement of the secession of Katanga antagonized the UAR, who viewed Katanga as part of a neocolonial conspiracy to divide Africa. In Table 1, many of the words in the 1960 cluster reference the early months of struggle over the future of the Congo. From the outset, Nasser actively supported Lumumba, and eventually approved the sending of UAR troops as part of the United Nations mission. Nasser also traveled to the UN in September 1960, and behind the scenes tried to mediate a solution among the nonaligned and superpower countries. Many of the words in this first cluster also touch on the issues at stake such as the demands for Belgium’s withdrawal, calls for anti-colonial solidarity, and questions over the United States’ role in the conflict. In the 1961 cluster, the words underline how the conflict became much more acute from the UAR’s perspective. First, the Casablanca Conference convened in January, bringing together the more radical African states, in part to discuss the issue of the Congo. Then, the UAR’s troops finally returned from the Congo, which was followed by the news on February 14th of Lumumba’s assassination. The news was front-page in Cairo, and also inspired mass protests and rallies around the city. While none of the words in the 1961 cluster definitively represent this moment, this cluster helps convey the intense political stakes of the crisis from Cairo’s perspective, which I had previously identified after for the conference paper. 

In my paper, I don’t spend much time on how the UAR discussed the Congo from 1962-1963. Part of my rationale was that the UAR’s focus was elsewhere, especially after the breakup of the union with Syria in the fall of 1961. Furthermore, events in the Congo appeared to be resolving with Adoula’s selection as Prime Minister under Kasavubu and the reconciliation of the Gizenga and Kasavubu governments. Yet, for this study, I decided to visualize the clusters for 1962 and 1963 to confirm my assumption. Unlike 1960 or 1961, the words in the 1962 cluster emphasize development rather than ‘high’ politics. In my opinion, this shift was the result of a growing focus in the UAR on development as a means for strengthening both the domestic revolution and ties with new revolutionary African states. Furthermore, the Congo became even less central in 1963, with the word only appearing when the term depth was increased to include 750 of the top terms, and the terms focused on trade topics. Thus, these findings reinforce my argument that the Congo remained largely sidelined until the resignation of Adoula and the return of Tshombe as Prime Minister in the summer of 1964, which rekindled Cairo’s involvement and interest in the Congo. 

In the 1964 cluster, the words highlight how the Congo once again became front-and-center in Cairo with Tshombe’s attempt to attend the Second Non-Aligned Conference in early October 1964, which resulted in a crisis between the two countries. While the crisis was eventually resolved when Congolese troops allowed the UAR staff to return to Cairo and Tshombe was subsequently released from Cairo, on Thanksgiving Day a mob of African students attacked the American embassy in Cairo. Unlike previous demonstrations, this mob was not well publicized in the UAR press. This omission was likely due to the fact that this protest was not actively organized by the UAR, and the damages further strained US-UAR relations. One of the shortcomings of textplot is that individual events like the protests after Lumumba’s death or the Thanksgiving Day riots are difficult to discern from this 30,000-foot perspective. Nonetheless, the cluster hints at how the UAR press became increasingly vocal in its condemnations of American involvement in the Congo and its support for the Congolese rebels. These tensions came to a boiling point after the shooting down of an American civilian cargo aircraft by the UAR on December 19th, and Nasser’s Victory Day speech at Port Said on December 23rd. In the speech, Nasser essentially declared his refusal to bend to American demands around the Congo. The speech marked a breaking point in the US tolerance for the UAR’s support of the Congolese rebels, with the US threatening to end all food aid to the UAR. The majority of this activity occurred behind the scenes, and this cluster helps highlight the disconnect between the UAR’s public and private statements.

In the paper, I describe how Nasser faced with a significant economic stick quickly tried to backtrack but faced difficulties in convincing the US of his policy shift. The largest obstacle was the fact that numerous Congolese rebels were in Cairo, with reports circulating of 3000 rebels in the city. Some of the key Congolese rebel leaders, such as Gaston Soumialot, traveled to Cairo in December 1964, and then again in mid-January 1965 to generate support for the rebels among the Arab Premiers in Cairo for Arab League Conference. With the support of the UAR, the rebels were attempting to bring together all the rebel groups for a conference in Cairo in early April. However, many of the main leaders never arrived and the conference was postponed indefinitely. In the 1965 Congo cluster, the words highlight some of these events, especially January, meeting, delegation, and security. In the paper, I describe how by the summer of 1965, the UAR had expelled the remaining rebels from Congo, and ensuring the continuation of US food aid on a temporary basis. For *The Arab Observer *corpus*, *there a few issues from the first half of 1966, but Congo only appears 39 times in the corpus, and thus are omitted from this case study. I end the paper with a consideration of how the Congo was increasingly marginalized and eventually omitted from discourses about the UAR’s anti-colonialism, as well as some of the consequences of the Congo crisis for US-UAR relations. 

Overall, using the textplot to analyze *The Arab Observer *offers no smoking gun for my paper, but rather reaffirms my initial analysis. Specifically, my argument that the UAR tied the Congo to anti-colonial struggle during its immediate outbreak in 1960 and 1961, and that this identification of Congo with struggle died down in 1962 and 1963, only to remerge in 1964 and early 1965 around the Simba rebellion. This method seems overly complicated for reading a weekly periodical that had a run of six years. Yet, using distant reading tools offers two advantages to close reading. First, I believe that my interpretation now rests on firmer footing, being a product of both close reading and quantitative analysis. While all interpretation remains subjective, visualizing these connections helps make my analysis more transparent, which I believe only strengthens my argument. Second, while using textplot to validate previous analysis is useful, the method becomes even more valuable when working on larger corpuses, such as the full run of daily Egyptian newspapers from 1952 to 1970.  While reading a weekly periodical is possible, reading every issue of *The Egyptian Gazette *or *Al-Ahram *would take years, and even then there’s the danger of not seeing the forest from the trees. Distant reading tools like textplot help manage large corpuses, and visualize the connections between topics/clusters in a corpus. Ultimately, I believe that combining both close and distant reading is crucial for uncovering both the patterns and exceptions in my sources.

For the sake of brevity, I will not go into mapping with the case study, but many of the place names that show up in *The Arab Observer *could potentially be the basis for tracing the construction of Cairo’s anti-colonial geography, similar to Blevins’ model of examining the production of space in Houston. Moreover, textplot is one tool for distant reading among many, and other corpus linguistics tools and statistical models will help elucidate additional patterns. To conclude, this case study was designed to illustrate how I plan to use distant reading tools and suggest their utility for my dissertation.
